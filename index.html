        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>Inline style CSS applies to specific HTML tags.</li>
          <li>Most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Text-align is a way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>We can have more than one condition by using else if statement.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>Arrays are especially useful when we want to perform a task on multiple pieces of data at once.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>To declare a function, we use the function keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses.</li>
          <li>Then we add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform.</li>
          <li>To call a function, we use the name of the function in our JavaScript file where we want the code to execute.</li>
